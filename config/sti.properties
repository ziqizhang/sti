# Folder containing cached data (must be ABSOLUTE PATH). Whenever KB search or Web search is performed, the query and results are cached in a Solr instance. This specifies the path to Solr. (by default this is the /cache/empty folder in the distribution. The folder contains only solr schemas, but no data. This means you can use them directly as long as you correct the path. And the system will begin with remotely querying KB or the Web and gradually builds up the cache).

# When STI is run in batch mode (e.g., processing a folder containing multiple input files, by using an instance of uk.ac.shef.dcs.sti.experiment.STIBatch), it loads in all files and sort them by file name. If for any input file the process failed due to any exception, the indexes of such files (as index of the file in the sorted list) are written to this provided file.

# Input files must be parsed to create an internal uk.ac.shef.dcs.sti.core.model.Table objects. Depending on the input data files, specific TableParser class must be implemented and specified here. The class must have a defult constructor that does not take any arguments

#	SELECTIVE START (generic)	   #
####################################
# STI tries to classify the data type of table columns, and typically only certain types of columns are passed for interpretation. While this process is highly accurate, it is not guaranteed to be perfect so in some occassions it is possible to have, e.g., NE-columns mis-classified as numeric, or long text. Therefore, for all input tables, if you know some columns should not be considered for interpretation, specify them here as a comma delimieted string. E.g, '0,1,5' will tell STI to ignore the first, 2nd and 6th columns in input tables.

################################
#	SELECTIVE START (batch)	   #
################################
# when running in batch mode, instead of always processing the entire input folder, starting from the first file, it is possible to make the process selective by defining the following parameters

# Given the input files read from a folder sorted by their file names, you can choose to start from a particular index position in the sorted list. The first file's index is 0. This is useful when, e.g., the previously process broke down and you want to continue from a particular position. The index position of each processed input file will be output in the log file
sti.start=0
# Similar as above, you can provide a list of indexes representing the files you want to process. Note that if this variable is defined, ONLY THESE SPECIFIED files will be processed. This variable must be an absolute file path pointing to a plain text file, where each line is the index of a file in the sorted input folder. Leave this variable empty if you do not want to be selective
